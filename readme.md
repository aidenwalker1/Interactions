How to use:

1. Go to run_program() at bottom
2. Change path to file where data is on your pc
3. Change read_range to length to read from file
4. Change time to intervals where interactions occured in the data - if want to test model accuracy over that range
5. Run and verify 

Prints out accuracy data, shows graph of rssi average, and shows graph of when interactions occured vs when model thought it did.
